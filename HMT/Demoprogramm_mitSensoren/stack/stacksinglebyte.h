/**
 * Stack implementation using the PHY single-octet mode
 * 
 * The PHY UART is used to handle UART frames singly.
 * 
 * The general operation is the same as for the multi-octet stack
 * implementation, but now the checksum checks must be carried out
 * by the stack.
 * 
 * The @ref StackTransparent::_ddlMode "_ddlMode" member defines the
 * state of the data-link layer.  In  @ref IoLink::DDL_MODE_IDLE "DDL_MODE_IDLE",
 * the device drives the CQ line according to the sioLevel set, and
 * the @ref StackBase::SioDriveMode "drive mode" defined .  The other states
 * support IO-Link communication.
 * 
 * @section section_implementation_details Implementation details
 * 
 * @subsection subsection_rx_uart Rx UART operation
 * 
 * Following receipt of a UART frame, a timer is started in the PHY.  If
 * more frames are expected (no transmit is received) and the next frame
 * is not received within the expected time, then the PHY reports a
 * communication error and any partially received sequence is discarded.
 * Following a parity or checksum error, any partially received sequence
 * is similarly discarded.
 * 
 *  @subsection subsection_establish_comms Establish comms
 * 
 * If a short-circuit is detected by the PHY in SIO mode, (possible WURQ),
 * updates of the SIO are temporarily silenced by introducing a delay
 * before the next user code call.  If an exchange does not complete in
 * this time, then the stack will automatically switch back to SIO operation
 * after ca. 100ms.
 * 
 * @attention The single octet mode handshake requires the device to be
 * in IO-Link mode.  The device @b must be placed into IoLinkListen mode
 * before the first LINK::END command is returned following the reception
 * of the firs UART frame.
 * 
 * The PHY is switched to IoLinkListen mode after a delay once the line
 * is in at high impedance in SIO operation.  This allows for the reception
 * of UART frames despite the lack of a wake-up request.  This reception
 * may be interrupted if the device drives the CQ line, and a retry is
 * required.
